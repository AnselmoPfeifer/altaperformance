 * Various strategies for String Duplication have been considered, but the one
 * implemented now follows the following approach: Whenever the garbage
 * collector visits String objects it takes note of the char arrays. It takes
 * their hash value and stores it alongside with a weak reference to the array.
 * As soon as it finds another String which has the same hash code it compares
 * them char by char. If they match as well, one String will be modified and
 * point to the char array of the second String. The first char array then is no
 * longer referenced anymore and can be garbage collected.
 * 
 * This whole process of course brings some overhead, but is controlled by tight
 * limits. For example if a string is not found to have duplicates for a while
 * it will be no longer checked.
